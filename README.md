# AstroUMD


The "astroumd" name has several meanings here:

1. The https://github.com/astroumd organization, where department members can place their
   more public repos (e.g. classes, common software).

2. The name of the astronomy department network (the one in PSC and ATL)

3. A set of scripts to help you integrate your unmanaged laptop (or desktop) in the "astroumd" network
   and do astro-computing
   (think printing, ssh(fs), vnc, vpn, etc.). Primarely for POSIX based (Linux and Mac) systems, but may
   still contain useful tips for those who use Windows.
