# AstroUMD


The "astroumd" name has several meanings here:

1. The https://github.com/astroumd organization, where department members can place their
   more public repos (e.g. classes, common software).

2. The name of the astronomy department network (the one in PSC and ATL)

3. A set of scripts to help you integrate your unmanaged laptop (or desktop) in the "astroumd" network
   (think printing, ssh(fs), vnc, vpn, etc.). Primarely for POSIX based (Linux and Mac) systems, but may
   still contain useful tips for those who use Windows.
